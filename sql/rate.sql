UPDATE ALBUM SET comments="CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THIS WAS A 24 SONG ALBUM. If this album was cut in half (aka they removed the crap filler songs) it would be unreal. Some all time favorites on here like Narcos, MotorSport, Notice Me, Too Playa. Stir Fry may be my least favorite song of 2018 tho dont @ me.", rating=72 WHERE id=382;
UPDATE ALBUM SET comments="This is a tough one because I love Jazz Cartier... His style is just too 'big' and 'in your face' for me to enjoy a full albums worth. The beats are absolutely MASSIVE (this is a KTOE beat??). My favorite songs off this album are Soul Searcher, Talk 2 and Tempted because of his flow. But like.. if Right Now comes on you can catch me setting a new bench press prr for sure.", rating=69 WHERE id=251;
UPDATE ALBUM SET comments="Featuring some of the most hype songs in Kanye's discography, Yeezus contains some absolute bangers but definitely isn't everyones taste. You can make a reasonable gym playlist just from this album (Black Skinhead, New Slaves, I'm In It, Blood On the Leaves). Not to mention this album contains the infamous Bound 2... honestly one of my favorite kanye songs accompanied with one of the greatest music video moments in history. Short story: Yeezus has a lot of synths and 808s and is very in your face because 2013 Kanye was god remember?", rating=71 WHERE id=259;
UPDATE ALBUM SET comments="A gooooood trap album. A lot of the melodies and beats start to sound repetitive on this, but they are good melodies and beats at least. Some god level songs like Dubai Shit, How U Feel and Where U From. No deep lyrics or cool experimental sounds to be found here. Since this is basically a Migos Travis Scott collab I DARE you to count the amount of adlibs in this album. Answer: a lot.", rating=70 WHERE id=113;
UPDATE ALBUM SET comments="An all-time classic. Solidified NAS as one of the greatest. A real product of it's time, if you like great lyrics and flow with classic 90's beats this is for you.", rating=94 WHERE id=393;
UPDATE ALBUM SET comments="Playboi Carti is an interesting rapper because I cant tell if he is trying to use his voice for lyrics or the beat. This album is an example of EXTENSIVE adlib usage (puts migos in the dust). There are some catchy and 'different' sounding songs on here like Shoota (feat. Lil Uzi Vert), Lean 4 Real (feat. Skepta) that both contain a solid beat, tight flows and a feature that adds to the song. Overall, not much going on here lyrically or thematically as an album IMO.", rating=48 WHERE id=627;
UPDATE ALBUM SET comments="No comment.", rating=56 WHERE id=551;
UPDATE ALBUM SET comments="Rae Sremmurd you THINK im gonna listen to a 27 SONG ALBUM?? They do not have the ability to make that many good songs so right away I'll save you the time and list what the album should have been: Bedtime Stories (feat. The Weeknd), Perplexing Pegasus, Powerglide (feat. Juicy J), T'd Up, Heat Of The Moment, Guatemala (EVEN THOUGH THIS SONG IS A CLEAR RIP OFF OF UNFORGETTABLE BY FRENCH MONTANA) and then they could add maybe 5 crap filler songs MAX. Not a good time. Not a good album.", rating=28 WHERE id=496;
UPDATE ALBUM SET comments="A collection of Kendrick's unreleased work around the Good Kid Mad City/To Pimp A Butterfly era. Heavily Jazz influenced which I enjoyed. Many of the songs contain long drawn out interludes/intros/outros but that is expected given it isn't an actual album and I think it adds a cool change from Kendrick's usual 'highly polished' albums. Its like a rap version of an unplugged album?? Maybe not but Untitled 2, 6, 7 and 8 all bang so give it a listen. Doesn't dissapoint.", rating=82 WHERE id=5;
UPDATE ALBUM SET comments="This album is an absolute TRAP to give an opinion on. It seems like it's everyone's favorite album to claim as their Kanye favorite. I'm not sure if this is to seem edgy? deep? Either way it's not my cup of tea, personally. It still comes across to me as a very experimental Kanye album and I like that. Artist's have to try new things or else all music would eventually get boring. Songs like Heartless, Amazing (feat. Young Jeezy) and Love Lockdown are great and the album definitely follows a central theme but most of the other tracks on this just dont do it for me.", rating=59 WHERE id=255;
